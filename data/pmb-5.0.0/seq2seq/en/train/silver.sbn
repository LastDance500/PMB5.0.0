The 58th Rally Finland, the ninth rally of the 2008 World Rally Championship season took place between July 31 and August 3, 2008. The event was the first rally held after a six-week mid season break. The rally was based in the city of Jyväskylä in the centre of Finland with the special stages held on fast gravel roads in the lake district area of the country. The winner was the reigning world champion Sébastien Loeb, who became only the fourth non Scandinavian driver to win the event in fifty-eight runnings. It was his sixth win of the season and reduced the gap in the championship standings between himself and Finland's Mikko Hirvonen to just one point.

The Friendship Games, or Friendship-84 (, "Druzhba-84"), was an international multi-sport event held between 2 July and 16 September 1984 in the Soviet Union and eight other socialist states which boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.Although Friendship Games officials denied that the Games were to be a counter-Olympic event to avoid conflicts with the International Olympic Committee, the competition was often dubbed the Eastern Bloc's "alternative Olympics".

The 2010 Jordan Rally was the third round of the 2010 World Rally Championship season. The rally took place over April 1–3, and was based beside the Dead Sea, some from the country's capital, Amman. The rally was also the third round of both the Production Car World Rally Championship, and the Super 2000 World Rally Championship. Sébastien Loeb won the 56th WRC rally of his career, taking the lead midway through the second leg, and holding on to win by 35.8 seconds ahead of Jari-Matti Latvala, who had been the pacesetter on the first day. Petter Solberg finished third, taking his second successive podium after his second in Mexico.Much of the talk on the rally was down to controversial team orders in relation to road position. Citroën Junior Team's Sébastien Ogier left the final morning's service five minutes late, getting a time penalty that dropped him behind Ford's Latvala. Ford used Mikko Hirvonen – who had retired on the first day, and was returning under SupeRally conditions – as their hand, to leave service early so he jumped up the running order. Citroën countered by making Ogier check into the time control at SS14 eight minutes early, to road sweep ahead of Loeb. Citroën later stated that Ogier's late departure was due to an electrical problem. Ogier's teammate Kimi Räikkönen finished eighth and became the second driver after Carlos Reutemann to score drivers' championship points in both Formula One and the World Rally Championship.In the SWRC, Xavier Pons won his second consecutive event, and again managed to break into the top ten placings in the overall standings. His margin of victory over Eyvind Brynildsen was nearly twelve minutes, as he moved into a ten-point lead in the SWRC standings. Sweden victor Per-Gunnar Andersson finished third ahead of Nasser Al-Attiyah, Patrik Sandell and Jari Ketomaa.In the PWRC, Patrik Flodin took his second victory in two starts, beating Armindo Araújo by close to two minutes. Araújo's second place was enough to maintain his lead in the championship standings, but Flodin now trails by just eight points. Nicholai Georgiou finished third.	time.n.08 YearOfCentury 2010 event.n.01 Name "Jordan Rally" Time -1 be.v.01 Theme -1 Time +1 Co-Theme +2 time.n.08 TPR now round.n.01 Order 3 PartOf +3 time.n.08

The 1938 British Empire Games was the third British Empire Games, the Commonwealth Games being the modern-day equivalent. Held in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia from 5–12 February 1938, they were timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia). Venues included the Sydney Cricket Ground (the main stadium), the Sydney Sports Ground, North Sydney Olympic Pool and Henson Park. An estimated 40,000 people attended the opening ceremony. A competitors' residential village was established within the grounds of the Sydney Showground.The star of the games was the Australian athlete Decima Norman, who won five gold medals in track and field. Margaret Dovey, the future wife of Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam, finished sixth in the 220 yards breaststroke.Due to the onset of World War II, the games were not held again until 1950.	time.n.08 YearOfCentury 1938 location.n.01 Name "united kingdom" location.n.01 Name "Empire" game.n.01 EQU -3 Source -2 Source -1 be.v.01 Theme -1 Time +2 Co-Theme +6 be.v.01 Theme -2 Time +2

The 2013 French Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts. It was the 117th edition of the French Open and the second Grand Slam event of the year. It took place at the Stade Roland Garros from 26 May to 9 June. It consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair players also took part in singles and doubles events.Rafael Nadal was the three-time defending champion in the men's singles, and won the title to become the first man to win the same Grand Slam title eight times. Maria Sharapova was the defending champion in women's singles, but lost in the final to Serena Williams.This championship was the third time in grand slam history that two multiple slam sets were accomplished in two different disciplines, and that was Serena Williams in Women's Singles, and her fellow countrymen Bob and Mike Bryan in Men's Doubles. At the 1969 US Open, Rod Laver won his multiple slam set in Men's Singles, and his fellow countryman Ken Rosewall did in Men's Doubles. At the 2012 French Open, Mahesh Bhupathi won a multiple slam set in Mixed Doubles, and Esther Vergeer won her multiple slam set in Women's Wheelchair Doubles.In the women's singles final, it marked the first French Open since 1995 that the top two seeded players had played each other in the final, and the first time at any grand slam event since the 2004 Australian Open that the top two seeded players had played each other in a grand slam final.	time.n.08 YearOfCentury 2013 event.n.01 Name "French Open" EQU -1 be.v.01 Theme -1 Time +1 Co-Theme +2 Location +7 time.n.08 TPR now

A presidential election was held in Iceland on Saturday, 26 June 2004.Unlike parliamentary elections in Iceland, presidential elections are not fought on the basis of party politics; instead, candidates attempt to use their personalities to attract supporters and appear as a living symbol of national unity.By tradition, the presidency is an almost entirely powerless office, as the presidents almost never use the powers granted to them by the constitution, instead just exercising "moral authority". Ólafur Ragnar, however, has expressed a wish to have a public discussion on the role of the head of state. Unprecedentedly in the history of the Icelandic Republic, on 2 June 2004 Ólafur Ragnar vetoed a media ownership law passed by the Althing. Davíð Oddsson, who was Prime Minister at the time, claimed that the veto was tainted because the president's daughter worked for Baugur Group, which had recently acquired roughly half of the country's media. There was little doubt that Ólafur Ragnar would be re-elected, but the veto controversy had an effect on the voting – the unprecedentedly high number of empty ballots (20.6% of the total) was thought to be largely a protest of the veto.	presidential.a.01 AttributeOf +1 election.n.01 time.n.08 TPR now time.n.08 TPR now hold.v.01 Theme -3 Time -2 Time -1 Location +1 Time +2 Time +4 location.n.01 Name "Iceland" time.n.08 DayOfWeek saturday time.n.08 DayOfMonth 26 EQU +1 time.n.08 MonthOfYear 6 EQU +1 time.n.08 YearOfCentury 2004 CONTINUATION <1 presidential.a.01 AttributeOf +1 election.n.01 NEGATION <1 parliamentary.n.01 election.n.01 MadeOf -1 Location +1 location.n.01 Name "Iceland" time.n.08 EQU now fight.v.01 Theme -5 Participant -3 Time -1 Location +1 basis.n.01 Theme +2 party.n.01 politics.n.01 Location -1 CONTINUATION <1 NEGATION <1 parliamentary.n.01 parliamentary.n.01 election.n.01 MadeOf -2 Location +2 election.n.01 MadeOf -2 Location +2 location.n.01 Name "Iceland" location.n.01 Name "Iceland" person.n.01 Role +1 candidate.n.01 attempt.v.01 Participant -6 Agent -2 Time +1 Theme +2 time.n.08 TPR now use.v.01 Agent -4 Recipient +2 Topic +3 person.n.01 personality.n.01 User -1 attract.v.01 Theme -7 Asset +1 person.n.01 Role +1 supporter.n.01 appear.v.01 Participant -13 Theme -10 Time +1 Attribute +3 time.n.08 EQU now live.v.01 Theme +1 symbol.n.01 Part +2 national.a.01 AttributeOf +1 unity.n.01 CONTINUATION <1 tradition.n.01 ContentOf +1 entity.n.01 presidency.n.01 be.v.01 Theme -3 Theme -1 Time +1 Co-Theme +2 time.n.08 EQU now almost.r.01 entirely.a.01 powerless.a.01 AttributeOf +1 office.n.01 person.n.01 Role +1 president.n.01 person.n.01 Role +1 president.n.01 just.a.01 exercise.v.01 Manner -8 Theme -9 Co-Theme -6 Agent -5 Manner -1 moral.a.01 AttributeOf -10 authority.n.01 EQU -11 NEGATION <1 use.v.01 Agent -9 Theme +1 person.n.01 Role +1 power.n.01 grant.v.01 Agent -2 Time +1 Recipient +2 Agent +3 time.n.08 TPR now person.n.01 constitution.n.01 NEGATION <2 just.a.01 exercise.v.01 Co-Theme -17 Agent -14 Theme -9 Manner -1 CONTINUATION <1 person.n.01 Name "Ólafur Ragnar" express.v.01 Agent -1 Time +1 Theme +2 time.n.08 TPR now wish.n.01 have.v.01 Pivot -1 Time +1 Theme +3 time.n.08 EQU now public.a.01 AttributeOf +1 discussion.n.01 Destination +1 role.n.01 PartOf +1 head.n.01 Theme +1 state.n.01 CONTINUATION <1 history.n.01 PartOf +1 Time +3 icelandic_republic.n.01 time.n.08 DayOfMonth 2 EQU +1 time.n.08 MonthOfYear 6 EQU +1 time.n.08 YearOfCentury 2004 person.n.01 Name "Ólafur Ragnar" veto.v.01 Location -6 Agent -1 Time +1 Theme +4 Causer +7 time.n.08 TPR now press.n.01 ownership.n.01 law.n.01 MadeOf -2 Theme -1 pass.v.01 Patient -1 Time +1 time.n.08 TPR now althing.n.01 CONTINUATION <1 veto.n.01 time.n.08 TPR now taint.v.01 Patient -2 Time -1 Time +1 time.n.08 TPR now CONTINUATION <0 event.v.01 Participant +1 person.n.01 Name "Davíð Oddsson" entity.n.01 EQU -1 be.v.01 Theme -1 Time +1 Co-Theme +2 Location +4 time.n.08 TPR now person.n.01 Role +1 prime_minister.n.01 time.n.01 claim.v.01 Proposition <1 Agent -6 Time +1 time.n.08 TPR now entity.n.01 EQU -9 recently.a.01 acquire.v.01 Agent -2 Manner -1 Theme +3 entity.n.01 Quantity 0.5 PartOf +1 country.n.01 press.n.01 PartOf -2 CONTINUATION <3 person.n.01 Name "Ólafur Ragnar" time.n.08 TSU now reelect.v.01 Theme -2 Time -1 CONTINUATION <0 entity.n.01 be.v.01 Time +1 EQU -1 Theme +2 Time +5 time.n.08 TPR now doubt.n.01 Quantity - Proposition <1 unprecedentedly.a.01 AttributeOf +2 high.a.01 AttributeOf +1 number.n.01 Part +11 empty.a.01 AttributeOf +1 ballot.n.01 EQU +1 percent.n.01 Quantity 20.6 PartOf +2 total.a.01 AttributeOf +1 entity.n.01 time.n.08 TPR now think.v.01 Time -1 Agent -5 Time +1 Theme +2 time.n.08 TPR now be.v.01 Co-Theme -9 Theme -7 largely.r.01 entity.n.01 Attribute -1 PartOf +1 veto.n.01
