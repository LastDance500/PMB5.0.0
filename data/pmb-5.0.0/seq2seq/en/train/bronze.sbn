Presidential elections were held in Benin on 4 March 2001, with a second round run-off on 18 March. They controversially resulted in the re-election of Mathieu Kérékou for a second term. Kérékou's rival Nicéphore Soglo, who had been president from 1991 to 1996, failed in his bid to reclaim the presidency; although he qualified to participate in the second round of the election against Kérékou, he refused to do so, alleging electoral fraud. Adrien Houngbédji, the parliament speaker and third-placed candidate, also refused to participate in a second round. As a result, Kérékou faced fourth-place candidate Bruno Amoussou, who was planning minister and had already given his support to Kérékou, in the second round; Kérékou won an easy victory with 84% of the vote.	presidential.a.01 AttributeOf +1 election.n.01 time.n.08 TPR now hold.v.01 Theme -2 Time -1 Location +1 Time +3 Instrument +6 Time +8 location.n.01 Name "Benin" time.n.08 DayOfMonth 4 EQU +1 time.n.08 MonthOfYear 3 EQU +1 time.n.08 YearOfCentury 2001 round.a.01 AttributeOf +1 runoff.n.01 Order 2 time.n.08 DayOfMonth 18 EQU +1 time.n.08 MonthOfYear 3 CONTINUATION <1 person.n.01 controversially.a.01 result.v.01 Theme -2 Manner -1 Time +1 Location +2 Duration +4 time.n.08 TPR now reelection.n.01 PartOf +1 location.n.01 Name "Mathieu Kérékou" term.n.01 Order 2 CONTINUATION <1 event.v.01 Participant +3 entity.n.01 rival.n.01 entity.n.01 Of -2 Theme -1 entity.n.01 EQU -1 be.a.01 Agent -1 Theme +1 Participant +3 Finish +4 person.n.01 Role +1 president.n.01 time.n.08 YearOfCentury 1991 time.n.08 YearOfCentury 1996 fail.v.01 Agent -6 Time +1 Location +3 time.n.08 TPR now male.n.02 bid.n.01 User -1 reclaim.v.01 Agent -1 Theme +1 presidency.n.01 allege.v.01 Agent -13 Theme +2 electoral.a.01 AttributeOf +1 fraud.n.01 CONTINUATION <1 male.n.02 ANA -7 refuse.v.01 Agent -1 Time +1 Theme +2 time.n.08 TPR now do.v.01 Agent -3 NEGATION <1 entity.n.01 NEGATION <1 so.v.01 Theme -5 Time -1 terra_incognita.n.01 EQU -3 Topic -1 CONTRAST <1 male.n.02 ANA -14 qualified.a.01 Experiencer -1 Stimulus +1 participate.v.01 Patient -2 Context +1 round.n.01 Order 2 PartOf +1 election.n.01 Destination +1 location.n.01 Name "Kérékou" CONTINUATION <1 adrien_houngbédji.n.01 EQU "Adrien Houngbédji" parliament.a.01 AttributeOf +1 person.n.01 Role +1 speaker.n.01 third-placed.v.01 Theme +1 person.n.01 Role +1 candidate.n.01 refuse.v.01 Agent -7 Time +3 Theme +6 refuse.v.01 Agent -6 Time +3 Theme +6 refuse.v.01 Agent -4 Time +3 Theme +6 time.n.08 TPR now time.n.08 TPR now time.n.08 TPR now participate.v.01 Agent -13 Theme +3 participate.v.01 Agent -12 Theme +3 participate.v.01 Agent -10 Theme +3 round.n.01 Order 2 round.n.01 Order 2 round.n.01 Order 2 CONTINUATION <1 result.n.01 kérékou.n.01 EQU "Kérékou" face.v.01 Theme -1 Agent +5 fourth-place.n.01 fourth-place.n.01 candidate.n.01 candidate.n.01 person.n.01 Name "Bruno Amoussou" Role -4 Role -2 person.n.01 Name "Bruno Amoussou" Role -4 Role -2 entity.n.01 EQU -2 entity.n.01 EQU -2 time.n.08 TPR now time.n.08 TPR now plan.v.01 Agent -4 Time -2 Theme +2 plan.v.01 Agent -4 Time -2 Theme +3 person.n.01 Role +1 minister.n.01 person.n.01 Role +1 minister.n.01 already.a.01 already.a.01 give.v.01 Theme -20 Agent -13 Manner -2 Manner -1 Recipient +2 Context +4 Context +5 male.n.02 ANA -61 support.n.01 Creator -1 EQU +1 kérékou.n.01 EQU "Kérékou" round.n.01 Order 2 artifact.n.01 Name "Kérékou" win.v.01 Agent -26 EQU -27 Time +1 Theme +3 time.n.08 TPR now easy.a.01 AttributeOf +1 victory.n.01 Part +1 percent.n.01 Quantity 84 PartOf +1 vote.n.01

General elections were held in Denmark on 5 June 2019 to elect all 179 members of the Folketing; 175 in Denmark proper, two in the Faroe Islands and two in Greenland. The elections took place ten days after the European Parliament elections.The elections resulted in a victory for the "red bloc", comprising parties that supported the Social Democrats' leader Mette Frederiksen as candidate for Prime Minister. The "red bloc", consisting of the Social Democrats, the Social Liberals, Socialist People's Party, the Red–Green Alliance, the Faroese Social Democratic Party and the Greenlandic Siumut, won 93 of the 179 seats, securing a parliamentary majority. Meanwhile, the incumbent governing coalition, consisting of Venstre, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservative People's Party whilst receiving outside parliamentary support from the Danish People's Party and Nunatta Qitornai, was reduced to 76 seats (including the Venstre-affiliated Union Party in the Faroe Islands).On 6 June, incumbent Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen of the centre-right liberal Venstre party tendered his resignation, and Federiksen was tasked with forming a new government. On 25 June, Frederiksen reached an agreement with the red block, and on 27 June she was appointed Prime Minister and her government, a single-party Social Democratic government, took office.	entity.n.01 general_election.n.01 time.n.08 TPR now hold.v.01 Theme -2 Time -1 Location +1 Time +3 Participant +5 Location +17 location.n.01 Name "Denmark" time.n.08 DayOfMonth 5 EQU +1 time.n.08 MonthOfYear 6 EQU +1 time.n.08 YearOfCentury 2019 elect.a.01 Agent -8 Theme +1 entity.n.01 Location +2 Location +5 Theme +6 Location +8 quantity.n.01 EQU 179 person.n.01 Quantity -1 Role +1 member.n.01 Of +1 event.n.01 Name "Folketing" time.n.08 YearOfCentury "XXXX" location.n.01 Name "Denmark" proper.v.01 Theme -7 entity.n.01 Quantity +1 quantity.n.01 EQU 2 location.n.01 Name "Faroe Islands" entity.n.01 Sub -1 Sub +1 entity.n.01 Quantity +1 Location +2 quantity.n.01 EQU 2 location.n.01 Name "Greenland" CONTINUATION <1 election.n.01 take.v.01 Goal -1 Time +1 Theme +2 Quantity +3 Time +4 time.n.08 TPR now place.n.01 day.n.01 Quantity 10 time.n.08 ESU +2 organization.n.01 Name "European Parliament" election.n.01 Creator -1 CONTINUATION <1 election.n.01 result.v.01 Theme -1 Time +1 Location +11 time.n.08 TPR now victory.n.01 Goal +2 red.a.01 bloc.n.01 Colour -1 comprise.a.01 Theme -3 Attribute +1 party.n.01 support.v.01 Agent -1 Time +1 Theme +2 time.n.08 TPR now social_democrats.n.01 leader.n.01 entity.n.01 Theme -9 Role -1 Participant +1 person.n.01 Role +1 candidate.n.01 Of +1 person.n.01 Role +1 prime_minister.n.01 CONTINUATION <1 entity.n.01 red.a.01 bloc.n.01 Colour -1 consist.v.01 Theme -3 Attribute +1 Attribute +2 Attribute +3 Attribute +4 Attribute +6 social_democrats.n.01 organization.n.01 Name "Social Liberals" organization.n.01 Name "Socialist People's Party" red-green_alliance.n.01 organization.n.01 Name "Faroese Social Democratic Party" entity.n.01 Sub -1 Sub +1 geological_formation.n.01 Name "Greenlandic Siumut" win.v.01 Participant -8 Agent -9 Time +1 Theme +2 Attribute +5 time.n.08 TPR now entity.n.01 Quantity 93 PartOf +2 time.n.08 YearOfCentury "XXXX" seat.n.01 EQU -1 secure.v.01 Agent -3 Theme +2 parliamentary.n.01 majority.n.01 MadeOf -1 CONTINUATION <1 entity.n.01 meanwhile.r.01 incumbent.n.01 governing.v.01 Attribute +1 coalition.n.01 Theme -2 consist.v.01 Theme -5 Theme -4 Attribute +1 location.n.01 Name "Venstre" organization.n.01 Name "Liberal Alliance" entity.n.01 Sub -1 Sub +1 organization.n.01 Name "Conservative People's Party" receive.v.01 Agent -6 Participant -5 Location +1 Theme +5 location.n.01 STO +2 parliamentary.n.01 entity.n.01 Theme -1 Source +1 organization.n.01 Name "Danish People's Party" entity.n.01 Sub -7 Sub +1 organization.n.01 Name "Nunatta Qitornai" time.n.08 TPR now reduce.v.01 Theme -14 Participant -13 Time -1 Value +2 quantity.n.01 EQU 76 seat.n.01 Quantity -1 Sub +1 Location +2 organization.n.01 Name "Venstre-affiliated Union Party" location.n.01 Name "Faroe Islands" CONTINUATION <1 quantity.n.01 EQU 6 time.n.08 Quantity -1 MonthOfYear 6 incumbent.a.01 AttributeOf +2 prime_minister.n.01 person.n.01 Name "Lars Løkke Rasmussen" Role -1 PartOf +4 centre-right.r.01 liberal.n.01 location.n.01 Name "Venstre" party.n.01 Role -3 Theme -2 Location -1 tender.v.01 Time -8 Agent -5 Time +1 Patient +3 time.n.08 TPR now male.n.02 resignation.n.01 PartOf -1 CONTINUATION <1 quantity.n.01 EQU 6 time.n.08 Quantity -1 MonthOfYear 6 person.n.01 Name "Federiksen" time.n.08 TPR now task.v.01 Time -3 Destination -2 Time -1 Theme +2 entity.n.01 form.v.01 Agent -1 Theme +2 new.a.01 AttributeOf +1 government.n.01 CONTINUATION <1 time.n.08 DayOfMonth 25 EQU +1 time.n.08 MonthOfYear 6 person.n.01 Name "Frederiksen" reach.v.01 Time -2 Agent -1 Time +1 Theme +2 time.n.08 TPR now agreement.n.01 Co-Agent +2 red.a.01 block.n.01 Colour -1 CONTINUATION <1 quantity.n.01 EQU 27 time.n.08 Quantity -1 MonthOfYear 6 female.n.02 time.n.08 TPR now appoint.v.01 Time -3 Theme -2 Time -1 Result +3 person.n.01 Role +1 prime_minister.n.01 entity.n.01 Sub -2 Sub +2 female.n.02 ANA -6 government.n.01 User -1 CONTINUATION <1 quantity.n.01 EQU 27 time.n.08 Quantity -1 MonthOfYear 6 single-party.n.01 social_democratic.a.01 AttributeOf +1 government.n.01 Theme -2 take.v.01 Time -4 Agent -1 Time +1 Theme +2 time.n.08 TPR now office.n.01
